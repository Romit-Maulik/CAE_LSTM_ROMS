# Convolutional autoencoders and long short-term memory networks for PDE emulation

This is supporting code for our manuscript available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.00470). We test the viscous Burgers equations (in the case of small viscosity when a sharp shock is obtained). We also test the inviscid Shallow water equations.
